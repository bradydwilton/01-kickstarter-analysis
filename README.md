The table of descriptive statistics below shows the following for all successful and failed Kickstarter campaigns for plays in the US:

The table above helps determine if the goal of $12,000 is suitable for Louise's campaign:
* The mean of failed campaigns is nearly twice that of successful campaigns, indicating that a lower goal may lead to a higher probability of success
* The upper boundary for successful pledge amounts to be considered an outlier is $10,949
  - Louise's goal of $12,000 would be an outlier if successful
  
## Recommendations Based on Findings

The analysis performed on 4,115 Kickstarter campaigns has led to the following recommendations regarding Louise's plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a play in the US:
1. A Kickstarter campaign is a viable option to fund a play in the US
2. The campaign should be launched during the months of May or June
3. Consideration should be taken to lower the campaign's goal
